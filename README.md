CortanaChat - 1-on-1 IP-based instant messaging for XBMC4Xbox, complete with friends list!

## Installation:
- Grab current release file.
- Unzip "CortanaChat" into the scripts folder your XBMC4Xbox installation, usually "Q:/scripts/". DO NOT RENAME THE FOLDER!
- Run the script and it will ask for your username and save it to name.txt.

# How to use:
- Run Cortana Chat and a menu will pop up, with the notification script automatically running in the background, even if you close the menu! This means you can still get messages even when watching movies or listening to music.
- To send a message, you need to know your friend's IP address. You can send a message directly to their IP via the "Send Message" button, which prompts you for their IP and the message you'd like to send, or you can add them as a friend (which has you input their name and IP address) so you can instantly message them!
- You can view your sent or received messages in the "Sent Messages" or "Received Messages" menus!
- Don't know your external IP address? Click "Show IP Address", tell your friend your IP, and now you both can chat Xbox to Xbox!

## To Do:
- Add timestamps to messages for proper sorting.

## Bugs:
- Currently, messages with commas (,) don't show up properly in the notifications. but they'll show up just fine in the "Received Messages" section! So if you receive a (half) blank message, that's probably why. Try not to use them!
